# CS 151 Graphics Contest!

Provided here is a very rough template and of course the `pgl.py` library to help you get going on your contest entry. Make sure you abide by all the posted rules, and good luck!!

I'm happy to provide rough advice on these, but I will probably try to do so without looking at any of your code, so that I can't unfairly influence anything. So if you are stuck on achieving something that you would like to do, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to answer or point you in a good direction, but I won't be helping with troubleshooting or anything like that here.
